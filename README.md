## MentalNote, the ToDo List App

## This app will allow users to create, delete, and filter through a list of ToDo items.  

## The user is greeted by a Navbar that allows them to navigate between two pages: ToDo and Contact.

## Under ToDo, the user will see a list of their ToDo items. Here they can delete or mark them as completed.

## The filter buttons at the top will display only completed or incomplete ToDo items.

## The user can then add a custom ToDo as well.
